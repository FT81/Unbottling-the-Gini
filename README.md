Three Jupyter notebooks (n=5, n=10, and n=20) demonstrate the transfer principle for the 
skewness-adjusted Gini coefficient. In addition, the two new skewness measures can be compared to
standard measures. How the measures are calculated is also shown in the Excel files,
it's also possible to check the axioms of scale and population invariance with them.
