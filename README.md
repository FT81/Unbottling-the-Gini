Three Jupyter notebooks (n=5, n=10, and n=20) demonstrate the transfer principle for the 
skewness-adjusted Gini coefficient. In addition, the two new skewness measures can be compared to
standard measures. How the measures are calculated is also shown in the Excel files, these can also be used
to check axioms like scale and population invariance.
