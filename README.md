# Unbottling-the-Gini
I provide Jupyter notebooks related to the manuscript "Unbottling the Gini: New Tools from an Old Concept".
The Gini coefficient is calculated from the distances between Lorenz curve and the 45-degree line.
Weights are put on these distances and resulting measures are calculated.
At the moment I have three notebooks that demonstrate the calculation of the novel measures for n=5, n=10 and n=20, the values are drawn from specified ranges.
Sensitivity to inequality and transfer sensitivity can be tested, all possible progressive transfers are considered.
The correlated extended Gini measures(sGini) with delta=1.5 and delta=3 are included for n=5 and n=10.
The notebooks allow to compare the novel skewness measures with conventional moment based measures.
Output to Excel allows an easy analysis of the datasets.
